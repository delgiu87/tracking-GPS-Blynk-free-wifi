gps tracking and data sendt to server Blynk from hot spot wifi free

ATTENTION: actually project do the job but we should improve some optimization battery sleep mode of ESP12 
and manage enable on GPS module. 
also wait to store in SPIFF memory and send one file to schedule data ora positions.
by PPS input we can improve time on and store and check latitude and longitude.
if less than area trigger shut down.



flash nodemcu on ESP12 by nodemcuflasher and upload by arduino this sketch .(remember to press both GPIO0 and Reset , release reset and then GPIO to start(only if don't use automatic programmer) 

go to blynk website, register and follow step to put widget map and setting V0 input
